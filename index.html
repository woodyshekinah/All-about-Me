    <h2>My hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        Before the pandemic I was struggling to diversify my interests and hobbies due to school demands.
        It was difficult for me to explore my hobbies and interests in a way to keep my mind stimulated.However, the pandemic came as a relief to me since I had enough time to discover my interests while maintaining a balance in work schedule.Here are some of them:
        <ul>
            <li>...Swimming</li>
            <li>...Listening to music</li>
            <li>...Dancing</li>
            <li>...Meditation</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Why did I join the DirectED program?</h2>
    <p>
        I am a philomath and therefore enjoy learning new skills.When the opportunity was presented to me I was so excited and quickly signed up to enrol.I am aware that coding is a skill that not many people in Kenya have and there is therefore a high demand for people with coding skills.I had already asked my parents to facilitate me to take coding classes immediately after high school but it was not possible because it was too expensive and out of their budget.The fact that DirectED is an organization that equips us with these skills for free made my dream possible and I therefore decided to join this program instead of idling around at home and I have absolutely no regrets!.I am more than grateful to the DirectED founders for this opportunity because without them I would have been at home wishing that my parents had more money to facilitate my coding classes.
