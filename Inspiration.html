        <h2>Why does he inspire me?</h2>
        <p>
            Michael Jackson is definately an icon.Through his music he relayed messages to the universe,messages that emphasized on love,peace and humanity.He had a rough up bringing having been brought up by an abusive father who would beat him up and force him to sing in front of multitudes of people for money.This caused him to develop so many insecurities especially about his nose.He sort help from plastic surgery.Michael did not have such a good life on earth despite the billions of dollars that he had.He had several medical conditions that forced him to full rely on pain killers his entire life and this eventually led to his death.He once had his head on fire while performing on stage and this led to injuries that changed his life.He also had vitiligo that caused his skin to change from black to white.Michael suffered from so much hate from the media and they accused him of being a pedophile and many other things such as his being homo-sexual and bleaching his skin.
            Despite all these allegations,Michael had a vision to make the world a better place through his music.He was a man filled with so much love that he would donate millions of dollars to feed children and help the needy.He always throw a hat to his fans ,a hat signed by him with a note saying 'lots of love from mike'.I listen to Michael every day and I am constantly reminded of humanity and love. He was definitely a good man and I know he is in heaven,happy and contented.

        <h2>Who they are</h2>
        <p>
           <strong> Mystical, transcendent, intuitive</strong>. These are all words that describe INIKO, the multitalented singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist from Brooklyn, New York. INIKO, whose pronouns are they/them.They first captured the public's attention with their 2022 song "The King's Affirmation." Inspired by Nicki Minaj's "Do We Have a Problem?" the track immediately went viral, receiving over 9 million YouTube views and earning INIKO a deal with Columbia Records.

            Their success continued last year with the release of "Jericho," a song that was widely remixed and covered on TikTok with over 27 million views on YouTube. Their emotional and emotive songs, powerful vocals, and eclectic style have made them a rising favorite among listeners and a standout in the alternative soul space.

        <h2>Why do they inspire me?</h2>
        <p>
           Iniko is an artist who is passionate about change. They view a world where no one is bound to retrogressive laws and mindset. They are at the forefront advocating for freedom in Palestine and many other countries going through the same situation.Through their song 'Jericho',they speak of breaking down walls like jericho crumble meaning that we are conquering all the retrogressive laws and mindsets that hold us back,that make us shy away from humanity.In addition to this I love their personality and their identity as queer.They are genderless.They do not conform to either male or female since this is a rule that someone created and that has had so many negative impacts on society.When I listen to Iniko, I feel the power of the universe and the power that is within me.I get the desire to embrace change and to break down the walls in my life like Jericho crumble.
